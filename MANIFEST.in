# Specify SCM files to ignore.
# - These files would not packaged by default, even without these rules,
#   but listing them here means we do not have to add a corresponing
#   --ignore option in the `check-manifest` call in `tox -e manifest`.
# - NOTE: Order this like `git ls-files`, to keep it easy to maintain.
